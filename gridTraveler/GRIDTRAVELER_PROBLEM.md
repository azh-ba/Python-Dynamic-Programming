**GRIDTRAVELER_MEMOIZATION**

Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.

In how many ways you can travel to the goal on a grid with dimension m*n? Write function `gridTraveler(m, n)` to calculate this.

gridTraveler(1, 1)       # --> 1
gridTraveler(2, 3)       # --> 3
gridTraveler(3, 2)       # --> 3
gridTraveler(3, 3)       # --> 6
gridTraveler(18, 18)     # --> 2333606220
